abstract: Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods have enjoyed increasing popularity in applications due to their faster convergence rate than Monte Carlo, and the existence of simple statistical tools to analyze the error of their estimates similar to Monte Carlo. In this paper we give a survey of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods, transformation methods for low-discrepancy sequences, and provide some examples.

* A survey of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods is given.
* Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods are used in estimating Sobol’ sensitivity indices.
* Transformation methods for low-discrepancy sequences are discussed.
* Applications to crack propagation and Rothermel’s wildland fire spread model are considered.

Andrea Saltelli has worked on physical chemistry, environmental sciences, applied statistics, impact assessment and science for policy. His main disciplinary focus is on sensitivity analysis of model output, a discipline where statistical tools are used to interpret the output from mathematical or computational models, and on sensitivity auditing, an extension of sensitivity analysis to the entire evidence-generating process in a policy context.

He has worked at the European Commission, leading between 2005 and 2015 a unit of econometrics and applied statistics. From November 2016 till June 2020 adjunct professor at the Centre for the Study of the Sciences and the Humanities (SVT) - University of Bergen (UIB), and between December 2017 and September 2021 visiting researcher at Open Evidence Research, Open University of Catalonia. He is presently visiting researcher at UIB-SVT, associate researcher at Institute for Cognitive Sciences and Technologies of the Italian National Research Council (CNR) and academic counsellor at UPF Barcelona School of Management.

His most recent papers have tackled sensitivity analysis and auditing, the ecological footprint, the future of statistics, the rational of evidence-based policy, the crisis of science and the post-truth discussion. Andrea gives courses in sensitivity analysis, sensitivity auditing, science integrity, and ethics of quantification. He has recently published on the role of science in processes of regulatory capture.Â

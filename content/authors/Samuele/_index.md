bio: From Dec 1 2019 I am working in the CREDS research centre (Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions), flexibility theme area. My research interests include energy systems, sensitivity auditing, uncertainty quantification and global sensitivity analysis, science for governance, modelling and model (knowledge) quality assessment. My research interests also cover complexity and complex systems (such as societies).

Samuele is a PostDoctoral researcher at the School of the Built Environment, University of Reading. His research in CREDS encompasses:

* the modelling of energy demand in Greater London;
* taking stock of the literature produced on flexibility in energy demand and its technological and social dimensions.

Samueleâ€™s research interest include modelling in the field of energy and sustainability. He is also interested in (epistemic and stochastic) uncertainty appraisal, modelling and knowledge quality assessment, ethics of quantification as well as sensitivity analysis. He is particularly interested in applying these frameworks at the science-governance interface as per the overarching post-normal-science approach.

Before joining CREDS, Samuele has been a PostDoctoral researcher at the Open University of Catalonia (Barcelona) in uncertainty and sensitivity analysis as well as knowledge/modelling quality assessment. In a previous postdoctoral experience at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology of the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Samuele has also worked on the multi-scale integrated assessment of the societal and ecosystem metabolism as regards its energy and waste-management dimensions. Samuele was awarded a PhD (honours) in physical organic chemistry and an MA (honours) in chemistry from Scuola Normale Superiore (Pisa, Italy). He also received an MA (summa cum laude) in organic chemistry and a BA (summa cum laude) from the University of Pisa.

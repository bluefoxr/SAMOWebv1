## Software

Software packages and addons that are useful for performing sensitivity analysis.
 
:computer: The [sensitivity package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sensitivity) in R.

:computer: [OpenTURNS](https://openturns.github.io/www/), an open source C++/Python library for the treatment of uncertainties, risks and statistics. See also its GUI: [Persalys](https://persalys.fr/index.php).

:computer: [UQLab](https://www.uqlab.com/), a MATLAB-based uncertainty quantification framework with state-of-the art, highly optimized open source algorithms (and good documentation).

:computer: [SIML@B](https://web.jrc.ec.europa.eu/rapps/pub/simlab/) provides a set of online tools to perform uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis (UASA) of model output.

:computer: [sensobol](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v102i05/), An R Package to Compute Variance-Based Sensitivity Indices

## Links

:link: [GdR MASCOT-NUM](https://www.gdr-mascotnum.fr/) is a French Research Group dealing with stochastic methods for the analysis of numerical codes. Its main objective is to coordinate research efforts in this scientific area, which is often called design, modeling and analysis of computer experiments.

:link: [andreasaltelli.eu](http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/) is the personal page of veteran sensitivity analysis researcher Andrea Saltelli, and hosts many useful resources (inlcuding books) on sensitivity analysis.
